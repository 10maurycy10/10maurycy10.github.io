- Color: 1 hour (133 * 30 seconds, though thin clouds)
- Equipment: C9.25, ASI533 MC (IMX533 OSC), Askar C1 Ha+Oiii filter, EQ6-R mount. 

HOO (Hydrogen-a, Oxygen-iii, Oxygen-iii) palette, very close to natural color except with bosted oxygen to make it less red. 
There was lots of atmospheric dispersion due to this target's low altitude.
I cleaned up the stars in post, but there's no way to fix the damage done to other parts of the image.
