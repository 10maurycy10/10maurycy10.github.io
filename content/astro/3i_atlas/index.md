- Equipment: C9.25, ASI533 MC (IMX533 OSC), EQ6-R mount. 

This was a bad night for shooting a magnitude ~17.5 object, with the moon, thin clouds and horrible dew.
... but considering what the weather's like at this time, I didn't know if I'd get another chance.

This comet is interesting is that it's *fast*, around 72 km/s at the time of taking this photo.
For reference, Jupiter orbits at a similar distance with a speed of around 13 km/s. 
This puts the comet at over 3 times escape velocity, much too fast for it to have simply fallen in from the outer solar system like most comets.

This is the third (and currently fastest) object discovered doing a high speed flyby of the solar system, hence the 3I designation. (I = Interstellar)
