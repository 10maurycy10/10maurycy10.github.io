This was a really bad night for shooting a magnitude ~17.5 object, with the moon, thin clouds and horrible dew.
But considering what the weather's like at this time, I didn't know if I'd get another chance.

The reason this object is intresting is that it's fast, around 72 km/s at the time of taking this photo.
For reference, Jupiter orbits at a similar distance with a speed of around 13 km/s. 
This puts the comet at over 3 times escape velocity, which is much too fast for it to have simply fallen in from the outer solar system like most comets.

This is the third (and fastest) object discovered on a high speed flyby of the solar system, hence the 3I designation. (I = Interstellar)
