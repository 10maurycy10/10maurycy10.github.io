## M42: Orion nebula [2025-02-19]

![](orion2_cc.jpg)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is left.</div>

Total exposure: 6 minutes (36 x 10 seconds)

Shot with a ASI533, 0.63 reducer and C9.25 SCT on an equatorial mount.
Processed with Siril.

## B33 + IC434: Horsehead nebula [2025-02-12]

![A very noisy photo showing the silhouette of the horsehead in front of a red nebula.](horsehead1.jpg)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is left.</div>

Total exposure: 8 minutes (50 x 10 seconds) (during full moon)

Shot with a ASI533, 0.63 reducer and C9.25 SCT on an equatorial mount.
Processed with Siril.

I had issues finding the Horsehead, and only ever had it in the corner of the frame.
Any part of the Horsehead was only included in around 15 frames, for around 2.5 minutes of effective exposure. 

## Earth's moon [2025-02-10]

![A photo of earth's moon, showing a good amount of detail in the craters and mares (frozen lava lakes). 3 of the edges are cut off, but the north pole is in frame.](moon1.jpg)
> <div style="text-align: center">The north pole is down</div>

Total exposure: 1 second (1000 x 1 ms)

Shot with a ASI533, 0.63 reducer and C9.25 SCT on an equatorial mount.
Processed with Siril.

## Jupiter [2025-02-10]

![A photo of Jupiter, showing the larger belts and zones. The moons are not visible.](jupiter1.png)

Total exposure: 1 second (100 x 10 ms)

Shot with a ASI533, 0.63 reducer (not a good idea here) and C9.25 SCT on an equatorial mount.
Processed with Siril.

## NGC2024: Flame nebula [2025-02-10]

![An image showing the flame nebula, and Alnitak. Stars are round and small. Dust surrounding the nebula is visible.](flame_denoised.jpg)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is up.</div>

Total exposure: 1.2 hours (870 x 5 seconds) (during full moon)

Shot with a ASI533, 0.63 reducer and C9.25 SCT on an equatorial mount.
Processed with Siril and GraXpert.

## M42: Orion nebula (with a telescope) [2025-01-28]

![A zoomed in photo of the center of orion's sword. Trapezium is resolved, and the entire frame is filled with nebulosity. Detail is visible in the dust in front of the core.](orion1.jpg)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is down/right.</div>

Total exposure: 100 seconds. (100 x 1 second)

Shot with a ASI533 and C9.25 SCT on an equatorial mount.
Processed in DeepSkyStacker and Siril.

## M42: Orion nebula (more data) [2025-01-26]

![A photo of orion, showing nebulosity in the sword, two nebula by Alnitak, one brown and one red nebula. The resolution is too small to see much detail.](longer.png)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is left.</div>

Total exposure: 1 hour, 12 minutes (240 x 13 seconds)

Shot with a Canon EOS M6 mark II, using the included lens (45 mm focal length), on an equatorial mount.
Processed in DeepSkyStacker and Siril.

The flame and Horsehead are in there if you squint.

## M42: Orion nebula (tracked) [2025-01-24]

![A noisy image of orion's sword, showing colorful nebulosity. The core of the nebula is blown out, and the image is fairly low resolution.](tracked.png)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is left/up.</div>

Total exposure: 4 minutes (20 x 13 seconds)

Shot with a Canon EOS M6 mark II, using the included lens (45 mm focal length), on an equatorial mount.
Processed in DeepSkyStacker and Siril.

## M42: Orion nebula [2025-01-22]

![A dim photograph of orion's sword, showing some nebulosity around the middle star. Brighter stars are blown out and egg shaped](first.png)
> <div style="text-align: center">North is up.</div>

Total exposure: 20 minutes

Shot with a Canon EOS M6 mark II, using the included lens (45 mm focal length), untracked.
Processed in DeepSkyStacker and Siril.
