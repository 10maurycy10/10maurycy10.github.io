## Assorted pictures of space, taken from my backyard:

What follows is a general explanation of how these are captured.
Feel free to scroll past if you just want to see the results.

Deep sky objects, like nebulae, are very dim and require many hours of exposure to capture properly.
However, a multi-hour exposure would require an impossibly precise mount and could easily be ruined by passing satellites and clouds.
Instead, I take multiple shorter exposures, which I then align and combine together into a single image.
This allows any imperfect frames to be removed, without throwing away more then a few seconds of data.

The final step is using a non-linear "stretch" function to brighten up the fainter parts of the image, bringing the dynamic range down to something that can be displayed on a monitor.

Some of these photos are narrowband or "false color" images, for which I used filters to capture very specific parts of the spectrum, and then (rather arbitrarily) assigned them RGB colors.
In these cases, I mention the palette used as something like this:
"Oxygen-Hydrogen-Sulfur", which would indicate that the red channel is the Oxygen-III line, green is Hydrogen-alpha and blue is Sulfur-II.

Planets and moons are very bright, but very small, with the views easily being spoiled by atmospheric distortion.
To deal with this, I record a high frame rate video in hopes of catching a brief moment of perfect atmospheric conditions.
I then stack together the sharpest frames from that video and apply wavelet sharpening to bring out the details.
