Most plastics are made from crude oil, but I don't have any on my property, and even if I did, oil is quite hard to get at.
Instead, I wanted to make silicone out of dirt, some sodium hydroxide (sold as lye and drain cleaner), and ethanol (sold as grain alcohol, get >70% or above). 

The goal was poly*ethyl*siloxane, very similar to the poly*dimethyl*siloxane used in comercial silicone rubber.

Dirt is mostly sand, and sand is mostly silica, often writen as {{< rawhtml >}}SiO<sub>2</sub>{{< /rawhtml >}}, but that formula is somewhat misleading.
Silicon, much like carbon, likes to form 4 bonds;
In silica each silicon atom is bound to 4 oxygens, each shared with another silicon, crosslinking the entire crystal into a single gaint molecule.

This is why silica, quartz and glass[^glass] are so hart to disolve, it's not that nothing can get between the molecules, it's that the enitre thing is one molecule.
To do any chemistry, I needed to disolve it, and to do that, I needed to break some of those crosslinks by adding oxygen with sodium hydroxide:

{{< rawhtml >}}<center>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> + 2 NaOH ➙ Na<sub>2n</sub>[(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>] + H<sub>2</sub>O</center>{{< /rawhtml >}}

<!--
Actually doing this reaction is quite tricky, you could just throw some sand in concentrated sodium hydroxide, but the reaction is very slow.
I didn't want to wait all month, so I melted up 4 parts hydroxide with 3 parts sand (by weight), and kept heating it for a few minutes to disolve.
The reaction generates water, if you do be prered for bubling, possibly splashing molten sodium hydroxide, *definatly* wear eye protection.

I use a steel can, but most metal containers (not aluminum, it will react) will work, the mixture will disolve glass and most ceramics.
The mixture is very sticky, so dump it out before it cools.

Next the hydroxide sand mixture can be crushed and extracted in boiling water for a few minutes.
If it worked, the sodium silicate solution should become quite viscous after being boiled down.

The hydroxide breaks off long, water-souble chains of silica, which will form the siloxane backbone of the plastic.

{{< rawhtml >}}<center>4 (SiO<sub>3</sub>) + 4 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH ➙ 4 (SiO<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)) + 3 O2 + 2 H2O </center>{{< /rawhtml >}}

It's also possible for an ethyl group to bond to two siloxane chains, crosslinking the plastic together:

{{< rawhtml >}}<center>2 (SiO<sub>3</sub>) +  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH ➙(SiO<sub>2</sub>)C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub></center>{{< /rawhtml >}}

Comercialy made silicone uses a totaly different process, starting with the hydrolysis of dimethyldichlorosilane to form polydimethylsiloxane without any cross links, gooey, but still liquid and soluble.
This silicone oil can then be cross linked with much smaller scale reaction, allowing the silicone to be molded without worriying about polymerization side products.

# Doing it from dirt

To make the task easier, I found some dry and relativly free flowing dirt:

Just about any dirt will work, but staring with fine, high mineral content dirt will result in a heigher yeild.

I first screened the dirt with remove larger rocks and organic material, and then washed it several times with water to remove silt and organic matter (floats).
At this point it look like rater nice sand, but had a lot of black iron oxides, I removed them with a magnet, but washing the sand with hot hydrocloric or sulphuric acid will likely work better.

At this point the sand was almost entirely silica:

To make the sodium silicate I made a 1:1 mixture of dry sand and sodium hydroxide, by weight.
This is an excess of sand in an atempt to minimize the amount of unreacted sodium hydroxide, 
I then heated the mixture in an iron container (glass and aluminium will disolve) 600 C for around an hour.

At this temperate, the sodium hydroxide melts, but silica and sodium silicate are both solids, preventing the whole thing from fusing into a chunk of glass. An excess 


My mixture ended up staying as a powder, so it was easy enough to extract silicate with boiling water.
Unfortuanly, the silicate is world class at cloging filters, because of the long chains and with its habit to crash silica when exposed to air.

Finaly, I squished goo to remove excess water and shape it into a ball for a few minutes: 

The final polymer is highly unsaturated polyethylsiloxane, and is quite
