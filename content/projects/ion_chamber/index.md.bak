To build an ion chamber, I soldered a wire to a small steel can as one electrode, drilled a hole and inserted a wire as the other electrode.
I covered the opening with a metal mesh. 
Alumium foil provides better sheilding from static electricty, at the cost of blocking alpha particles from entering[^foil]:

A larger can will work fine, and will be more senstive to beta and gamma.

When radiation enters the chamber, it ionizes some of the air inside, allowing a tiny, often sub-picoamp current to flow between the electrodes.

Air filled ion chambers are very sensitive to alpha, somewhat to beta but have fairly little gamma response.
Beta and gamma response can be improved by using a larger chamber, or by filling it with preasuresed {{< rawhtml >}}CO<sub>2</sub>, but this adds a quite lot of complexity.{{< /rawhtml >}}

**The main gotcha is that many "insulators" like PVC wire insulation, rosin flux, and glue are actually quite conductive down at the picoamp level.**
I left the base leads floating in the air and glued the Q1 to the can, making sure no glue touched the leads.
For larger chambers, plastic (polystyrine) beads work fine as stand-offs and feed-throughs.
Glue the wire into the bead's center, and glue the beed into the can, but avoid bridging the can and wire with glue.

# Amplfication:

I did not have a meter able to directly measure the few picoamps of ionization current, but a few transistors fixed that:

![Schamtic diagram showing a Darlington pair amplfying the signal from an ion chamber](darlington.png)
Use small signal trasitors, power ones will have too much leakage.

Voltage is not super critical, a volt or two per centimeter of electrode spacing is enough, 9 volts is a good starting point.

The Darlington pair provides a gain of around 30,000, but the real trick is using a multimeter on voltage mode.
That way the 10 megaohm impedance acts as a current shunt, allowing it to detect the rather feable current.

There is not much to love about this circuit, it is not very sensitive, and the gain and leakage drift wildly with temperature, but it does work, and highlights some to weird properties of alpha radiation:

- Properties of alpha

My cricuit is saturated by a 1 uCi (37 kBq) Am-241 source at 3 cm away, but at 4 cm the reading drops to near background.
This is because alphas are very good at ionizing air, and lose energy at a consistant 1.3 MeV per cm, and generating around 35,000 ion pairs in the process.
For the best alpha sensitivity, place the source against or inside the ion chamber, even just a few centimetres make a huge difference.

Because of this, I hade to make an attenuator to compare the sensitivity of different circuits.
To do this I cut a small .5 x .5 milimetre aperture in an alumium foil sheild over the chamber, the attenuation depended on how close the source was to the aperture:

|Distance from source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Attenuation factor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Alphas from 1 uCi Am-241:|
|-|-|-|
|2 mm|0.001|60 per second|
|5 mm|0.0002|9 per second|
|10 mm|0.00006|2 per second|
|15 mm|0.00003|1 per second|
|20 mm|0.000015|.5 per second|

# The power of time:

Instead of trying to amplfity the tiny, sub picoamp ionization current, it is easier to accumulate charge for some time and measure the resulting voltage.
I used a JFET's gate, because the gate can be discharged by momentarly pulling the drain or source low, avoiding the need for a seperate low leakage switch or very high value resistor. 
JFETs can also just a few picofarads of gate capacitance, so the tiny current will quickly create quite a sigificant voltage.

This will work with most JFETs, but a good low gate leakage, low gate capacitance JFET like the PN4117(A) will work a lot better.
These FETs will probobly contuinue to be avalabe because they are the best avalable technology for electrometers and similar devices.

I built up a farily simple circuit can discharge the FET once the gate reaches a certan voltage, converting the current into a frequency modulated pulse train:

![Schamtic diagram of an ion chamber with a pulse frequency output](nqg.png)

The JFET functions as a source follower, buffering the signal from the ion chamber into C1.
Once C1's voltage rises above a set threshold, Q5 and Q6 short C1 and the FET's drain to ground, discharging the gate trough the FET's intrinsic diode.
Additionaly, this creates a click from the piezo disk, creating quite a nice Gieger counter style audio indication.

If set to around 1 or 2 clicks per second this circuit is sensitive enough to enough to detect a single alpha particle as a sharp increase in click rate that lasts for a second or two.
My small chamber detects a background of 2 particles per minute, but this will vary depending on the amount of radon in your air.

The circuit is still not perfect, the threshold is temperature sensitive, and the short reset pulses are not quite enough to fully discharge the FET.
This creates a a far higher pulse rate background then just FET leekage alone when the circuit is set to frequently click.

Both of these can be avoided by simply using a microcontroller to handle the whole operation:

![Hooking up an MCUSchamtic diagram of an ion chamber with a pulse frequency output](mcu.png)

The micrcontroller should momentarly pull the source low to discharge the FET, and then after a few seconds measure the source voltage with it's ADC.
With a long integration time, a microcontroller can measure very small amounts of radiation, as well as callibrate out leakage current. [^leak]

[^foil]: Of course, if the source is placed inside the chamber, or is in the air like radon, the window material doesn't matter.

[^leak]: 
	Importantly the leekage current is not constant, for my FET, the leakage drops dirasticly above 3 V at the source.
	It might help to use a seperate pin with a zener diode in series for discharging, to bring the reset voltage up.

[^picoamps]: Excluding specialized pico/femto/atto ammeter equipment, but those are quite expensive.
