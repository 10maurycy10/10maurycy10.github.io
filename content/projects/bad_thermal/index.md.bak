A bolometer is rather weird way to detect light, by detecting the heat from abosrbing light.
This limits sensitivity and speed, but works at wavelengths which are otherwise very difficult to detect, like thermal infrared.[^bandgap]

At its simplest, a bolometer is simply a black object attached to a heat sensor, somewhat isolated from the suroundings.
Most bolometers use a thermistor as the heat sensor, but I did not have any, so I used a 1N4148 silicon diode.
A diode's forward voltage falls with temperature, generaly around -2 mV/K.

I covered the diode with lampblack (carbon) becuase it is a fairly good wideband abosrber, and built up a quick circuit to mesure the drop:

![A schematic of a diode as part of a voltage divider to mesure the voltage drop.](drop.png)

After the diode cooled to ambient temperature, touching it dropped the output voltage by a good 30 mV.
The biggest problem with this circuit is that it is effected by ambient temperature, even a fraction of a degree of difference will ruin the results.
The easiest fix is to add a second reference diode, and mesure the difference between the voltage drops:

There will be some voltage offset becuase 2 random diodes will not be perfectly matched, but this is constant and can be zeroed out.
Now the circuit can detect even a fairly small heat flow into the detector, but has no way of mesuring it.

This can be done by attaching a small heater, like a 1k resistor to the sensor.
To maintain a given temperature, the total power flowing into the sensor has to be constant, so the needed heater power will drop by exactly the input power.
With a simple opamp circuit adjusting the heater power to keep a constant sensor temperature, the input power can be mesured as the drop in heater power:

I glued to the sensor diode (D1) to the heater, but taping them together works.
The thermal mass of the heater/sensor/absorber assembly should be as small as possible to keep the thermal time constant resonable.

The detector is sensitive to drafts, make sure to sheild the reference and sensor diodes from any air currents.
Comercial bolometers are placed in a vacuum, but most vacuum chamber materials are opaque to thermal infrared, defeating the whole point.

To make a measurement, first measure a baseline heater voltage with no light hitting the sensor, then expose sensor to light.
After it reaches equilibrium, measure the heater voltage again.
Convert the 2 voltages to powers, `Power = Voltage^2 / 1000 Ohms`, and subtract for the mesurement.

Covering the sensor leaving just a small aperture, so that only radiation from a particular direction can reach it turns it into a terrible 1 pixel thermal camera.
Depending on the thermal mass of the sensor, it might just about be usable as a motion sensor.
Comerical motion sensors and thermal cameras use a similar detector, but one with much less thermal mass and with the absorber and detector in direct contact..

It works as a half decent laser power meter, but with a 1k heater resistor running off 5 volts, it will max out at just 25 mW.
This could be improved using a smaller value for the heater, using 100 ohms would bring the max up to 250 mW.

With a 50 ohm resistor attached to the sensor, it works as an RF power meter, but it is hard to get more then 20 dB of dynamic range from such a setup.
On the plus side, it would work from DC to daylight (literalyz).

[^bandgap]: Technically some very exotic semiconductors like Mercury Cadmium Teluride also detect thermal infrared, but these need to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to function.
