<!-- Intro -->

On the internet, you can find a lot of advice on how to design PCBs, particulary regarding ground planes and high speed/small signal routing.
But how much of this is correct, and does any of it matter for hobby projects?

<!-- Myths -->

Basicly everyone agrees that a ground plane provides a low inductance and low resistance return path for current, and prevents crosstalk/coupling between traces.

A ground plane does this by providing a return path[^return] that is physicaly close to the traces.
Inductive coupling between a circuit and the surronding magnetic field depends of the area of the loop, which minimized by a ground plane.
With capacitive coupling, the ground plane "shorts" the electric field between traces, mimimizing *mutual* capacitance.

After these basic points, everyone starts disagreeing.
Some people say that a ground plane should be on both sides of the board, while others say just one.
Some say that it should be split between different areas of the circuit, and others say this makes things worse. 
Some say that you should place a shield trace between fast signals, others say you should not.

So to test some of these claims, I desinged a (1.6 mm thick) board with pairs of 15 mm traces and 2 mm of clearance between them.
Both for capacitive and inducdtive coupling, long, paralel and nearby tracks are the worst case.
Each end of the traces had a pin, and if a ground plane was present, a ground pin was placed by the trace pins to keep the return path as close as possible:

One pair has no ground plane, another just a basic one on the back, and the rest have varations on ground planes:
- A split ground plane between two traces.
- A split ground plane with traces running across the split.
- A ground plane with a traces jumping onto the back layer. (One paralel and one across)
- A ground plane on both layers
- A ground plane on both layers with vias alongside traces.
- A ground plane on both layers with a shield trace
- A ground plane on both layers with a shield trace and vias alongside traces and on the shield.

I ran tests with a 50 MHz sine wave (10ns rise/fall times), which should be reprentative of a typical hobby project, but does not represent what happens in the microwave range. (Wavelength is much larger then the traces)

# Capacitive

To mesure capacitive coupling, I connected a function generator set to 5v, 50 MHz to one end of one trace, and a scope to the other end of the other trace.
For tests with a ground plane, I removed the stock ground lead of the scope, and added a short (<2cm) length of wire from the scope's ground ring to the ground pane.
For the tests with out one, I just clipped the scope's ground clip to the function generators.

![Capacitive coupling test setup](c.png)

The scope probe has ~10 pF of capacitance to ground, around twice that of a 74HC gate input.
These mesurments are only acurate to around 5%, so pay no attention to single milivolt differences.

|Coupled peak-to-peak voltage into 10 pF (More is worse)|Configuration|
|-|-|
|800 mV|No ground plane, ground provided by 15 cm scope ground clip.|
|340 mV|Standard ground plane.|
|352 mV[^split]|Split ground between traces|
|360 mV|Traces over split|
|351 mV|Standard ground with trace cutting across the ground plane crossing the tested traces|
|340 mV|Standard ground with trace cutting across the ground plane along the tested traces|
|294 mV|Double sided ground|
|300 mV|Double sided ground + via stitching|
|88 mV|Double sided ground + shield trace[^trace]|
|48 mV|Double sided ground + shield trace[^trace] + via stiching|

A ground plane reduces the capacitive coupling by more then 2 times, even in the worst case.
Spliting the ground plane, often recommended between power suppy, digital and analog sections increases coupling.
A double sided ground only improved things if both sides were connected with vias, and worked much better if a grouned shield trace was placed between the two traces (more than 16 times better!). 

At least at this much-smaller-then-a-wavelength scale, a short trace under the ground plane has a farly small effect.
I also mesured the signal coupled into the main trace from the one crossing it at on the back side at 153mV, sigificant, but not as nearly as bad as a paralel run.

Another thing of note about a ground plane is that traces over it have a sigifiacant capacitance to ground of around .7 pF per cm for the 1mm wide traces I used.
This could cause trouble for high impedence signals, even on relativly short traces.
Additionally, this capacitance will only get worse the more layers the board has, especialy with the common habit of placing the ground/power planes in the middle layers of the board.

The driving impednece matters a lot for capacitive coupling, when the victim trace was driven with a 100 Î© resistor, the coupled signal droped to ~1/4 of the original value.

# Inductive

For inductive coupling, I used a 50 MHz sine, but grounded the other ends of the traces.
I also added a ~10 Ohm current shut (10mV = 1mA) to mesure current and compensate for vareing inductances.

Again, these mesurments are only acurate to around 5%, so pay no attention to single milivolt differences.

|Shunt voltage peak-to-peak (More is better)|Coupled peak-to-peak voltage (More is worse)|Trace configuration|
|-|-|-|
|8 mV|62 mV|No ground plane, return path provided by scope/generator leads|
|12 mV|26 mV|Standard ground plane|
|11 mV|28 mV|Standard ground with trace cutting across the ground plane crossing the tested traces|
|10 mV|29 mV|Standard ground with trace cutting across the ground plane along the tested traces|
|8 mV|44 mV|Split ground between traces|
|9 mV|28 mV|Traces running over split|
|11 mV|28 mV|Two layer ground|
|9 mV|22 mV|Two layer ground + via stitching|
|10 mV|33 mV|Two layer ground + shield trace|
|10 mV|7 mV|Two layer ground + shield trace + via stiching|

The results here are similar to the capacitance results, and don't contridict any of the conculsions made there. 
While it looks like inductive coupling is insigificant compaired to capacitive coupling, it can effect traces with very low driving impedences (like the *0 Ohm* short used for testing), and the current used here was just a miliamp.

# Does any of this even matter?

This type of coupling can totaly be a problem especialy with digital singals.
Even of the frequency of a square wave is just a few kilohertz, it can have [components up into the hundreds of megahertz depending on the rise time.](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/square-waves-or-non-elephant-biology)
Digital lines themselves are fairly resistant to interference becauase of the low impedence output and that a fairly large voltage has to be induced to cause problems (up to 1/2 supply voltage for CMOS logic).

However, most projects at some point have to deal with analog signals, and these signals can easly be interfered with by fast switching nearby digital lines.
The simplest fix is to physicaly seperate digital and sensitve analog sections, as well as avoiding paralel traces between them.
Keeping the suppy clean with decoupling capacitors, ferrites and ground plane helps a lot too.
High impedence lines are very problematic, so avoiding them if possible and keeping them short is ideal.
A via stiched shield trace helps, but does add extra capacitance.

[^split]: This is the result I got after running a jumper to connect the 2 sides of copper fill. Without this the voltage was lower (150mV), because my scope and function generator were floating relative to each other.

[^trace]: The shield trace has just .5 mm clearence to the signal traces, so this configuration has some extra capacitance.

[^return]: The signal trace itself is only half of the circuit, and the return path is just as important.
