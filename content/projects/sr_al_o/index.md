Strontium aluminate is the brighest and longest-lasting glow-in-the-dark pigment.
Theoreticaly, it could be made by heating together strontium and alumium oxides, but mixing solds on an atomic level is impossible.
Melting them together requires temperatues above 1500 C, out of reach for most affordable furnaces.
 
In practice, it's made by heating the nitrate salts of alumium and strontium.
Both of these salts are water soluble -- making them easy to mix -- and decompose to the oxides at high temperatures:

> 2 Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + heat (~600 C)  ➙ 2 SrO + 4 NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>
>
> 4 Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + heat (~200 C)  ➙ 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 12 NO<sub>2</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub>
>
> SrO + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + heat (~1200 C) ➙ SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

This still needs rather high temperatues, but the're is a rather easy way to do this without using a furnace.

Strontium aluminate also needs small amount of lanthanide doppants.
I used a combination of Europrium (+2) and Dysprosium (+3), for that classic green glow, but the same procedure should work fine for other colors.

uminate, this is everything that I ended up using:

- Alumium metal
- Europrium (III) oxide
- Dysprosium (III) oxide
- Sodium hydroxide
- Strontium carbonate
- Nitric acid
- Hydrochloric acid
- Boric acid
- Urea

## Alumium:

I started by making alumium chloride by dissolving alumium metal in hydrochloric acid:

![](alcl.jpg)

> 2 Al + 6 HCl ➙ 2 AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> + heat<sub>lots</sub>

This reaction is very exothermic and generates large amount of hydrogen gas.
Use a large container, and very good ventilation.

This alumium solution was dark gray, but this didn't seem to impact the end product much.

Next, I added sodium hydroxide solution to convert the alumium choride to the insoluble hydroxide.
This reaction also works with most soluble alumium, like alum.

> AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 NaOH ➙  Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3 NaCl

Alumium hydroxide will redissolve in strong bases, so stop adding sodium hydroxide once alumium stops precipitating or the pH goes above 8 or so.

The resutling slugdy suspension was quite annoying to filter, and even worse to dry.
I ended up drying it in an oven, while being careful to keep it well below the rather low decomposition teperature of 180 C.

Later on this alumium hydroxide will be reacted with nitric acid to form alumium nitrate.
This could be done with just alumium metal, but the tends to passivate.

## Strontium aluminate:

These are the ratios I used:

<!--
Eu: 25.7 umol
Dy: 50 umol
Al: 4.5 mmol
Sr: 2.41 mmol
Urea: 63  mmol 
-->

||Mass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Molarity|
|-|-|-|
|Urea|8.41 g|14 mol| 
|Alumium hydroxide|0.78 g|1 mol|
|Strontium carbonate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|0.73 g|0.5 mol|
|Eurprium (+3) Oxide|0.01 g&nbsp;&nbsp;|0.005 mol|
|Dyprosium (+3) Oxide|0.02 g|0.01 mol|
|Total|||
<!--|Boric acid|0.18 g|0.3 mol|-->

I added everything **except the urea** to a small amount of water, and added nitric acid until it stopped bubling.
I heated it on a hot plate to allow the oxides and hydroxides to fully react with the acid, forming a clear nitrate solution.

I continued heating the solution until all the water and acid evaportated, leaving a solid mass of mixed nitrate salts:

![](evaporated.jpg)

<!--
Next, I dissolved the Europrium nitrate in a minimal amoiunt of water, and dropped in a chunk of zinc metal, while observing the reaction under UV light.
As the Europrium got reduced to +2, the charateristic pink flourecence disaperaed, at which point I fished out
Once the pink glow of the Eu (+3) was gone, I pipeted out the the solution and added it to the salt mass.
-->

- Yellow

I then redissolved the nitrate salts in a mininmal amount of water, added the urea, and and dried it on a hotplate.
As a warning, urea can form explosive salts with residual acid, so make sure the salt mass is very dry before adding urea.
I then again evaporated this solution on a hotplate set at 100 C, and once dry, I set it on fire with a blowtorch.

These high temperatures ignite the urea, which using the nitrate as an oxidizer, creates the high temperatures needed to form the strontium aluminate.
The reason for using urea here is that it's very cheap, produces minimal gas, and creates very high tempertues.
The excess uera also reduces the Europrium from the +3 to +2 state, allowing it to dope the strontium aluminate.

The burning urea and decomposing nitrates produce nitrogen dioxide fumes, which are quite toxic.
Do this outside or in a fume hood.

# Failures:

This syntesis took quite a few attepts.
My first attempts involved reducing the europrium with zinc and heating the nitrates in a furnace.
At the furnaces maxium 1000 C temperatue, by the time the strontium aluminate forms, all the europrium oxidizes.

Material heated for a long time was completly dead, but the shorter times yelded a faint yellow afterglow.
I think this was due to the formation of a strontium aluminate with the wrong ratio due to incomplete mixing.
Adding boric acid as a flux resutlted in some green glow, but it was still pritty terrible.

Next I tried quickly heating the nitrates with a small oxy-propane torch.
That produced some nice, if inconsistant, green emitting strontium aluminate.




Red dust:
Added random Eu, cooked at 800 for 30 min in graphite.
Reduction done in acid
Europrium A/B
Pink flourecence or none.

Less red dust:
Added correct amount of Eu, reduced in neutral conditions
Cooked at 1200 for 30 min in graphite.
Boric acid added as A/B test
Faint pink flourecence, some blue flourecence in boric acid sample.
Mostly YELLOW but some GREEN AFTERGLOW OBSERVED lasting for ~1s. Very dim (like SrS)
Can start optimizing now: Boric acid works better results!

Same as less red dust, but cooked in alumium oxide.
No glow. 
Carbon helps to reduce Eu?
Going to stick to graphite

Added Dy, kept Eu(2), reduced with coin zinc under neutral pH. Used 2 drops of sat Eu nitrate.
Seemd to cystalize early, going to A/B test mechanical griding.
Left: Solvent mixing, Right: Ground w/ morter
Same pale green with yellow afterglow, Solvent mixed was slightly better then griding.

Melting nitrate mass under oxy-propane on graphite lead to bright lumincence and good afterglow!
Beats SrS and can harvest visible light, not just UV.

Added citric acid 1 mol:each mol of metal:
Good mixing, short heating gave strong flourecence.
Still needs heating, no self sustaining combustion

3 nitrate groups needed per citric acid.
1 to 1 citric acid to tri/di vavalent metal nitrates should be good.
Don't know why it didn't burn

Citric acid combustion: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10971-009-1974-6
Dried citric acid containing mixture at 200 C, got it to burn.
Too fuel rich, left unburned carbon. 

Tied halfing citric acid and half urea A/B.
No self combustion, heated in furnace for 300C and 30 min and 1000C for 30 min.
Microwave sythesis 

https://zitounlab.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/zitoun24.pdf Sugests using very large amounts of urea
Used 2.42 mmol of Sr, 32 mmol or urea, ~13 mol of urea per mol of SrNO3. Reaction reduced Eu(III) to Eu(II).

Tried large excess of urea. 
Using Eu(III)
A/B Microwave/hotplate heating
Both worked, but large amount of fumes released before composition.
Flourecnece but very dim afterglow

Try increasing urea and removing boric acid per zitoun24.pdf
Boric acid probobly impeads crystalization under the very brief reaction times.
A/B boric acid.
Both produced faint glow, diffuse (no bright spots)

Observed reheating product with torched yelded vert good luminecence.
Tring preheating to 600 C before burning to increase max temp and slow cooling.

## Safety note

Just about every step involves high temperatues or caustic chemicals, or can produce toxic gas.



#  To try:
	- Anneal in furnace
	- Nitrate rich mixture
	- Glycerol to polymerize acid?
	- Oxy propane furnace
	- Inert atmoshpere (DIY tube furnace?)
	- Fe-free reagents
	- Paper clames boron will reduce Eu(III) to Eu(II) https://hal.science/hal-03857050/document

Try zinc reduction in NaOH solution as per 10.1039/C9DT03139A 
Also try adding lots of additional nitrate salts?

Try electrochemical reduction (hard without seperated cell)

Europium (+2) salts are supposidly not stable in water, oxidizing to +3, but they don't seem to do this in the reaction conditions.
