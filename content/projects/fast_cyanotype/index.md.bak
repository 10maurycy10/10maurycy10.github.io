## Procedure:

1. Spread the sensitizer on the paper. It doesn't take much, just slightly wet the surface.
I find spreading it with a glass rod works much better then a painting it on.
2. Let the paper dry in a dark area.
3. Expose the paper.
4. Apply the developer solution. No finesse required: just pour it on.
5. Wash the print with water for a minute or so to remove the unreacted chemicals. Even an invisible amount of residue can fog the image.

The paper should be protected from stay light during the process. 
The developer solution can be reused multiple times: apply it liberally and collect the excess. 

## Results:

![Exposure test strips](test_strips.jpg)
<center style="color: gray">Left: Classic (5 seconds/tick). Right: Mine (1 second/tick)</center>

My version is around 5 times as sensitive, has better preserved highlights, allowing it to acheave comparible results in 1/20th the time:
enough to turn what would be a 3 hour exposure into a 10 minute exposure.

Using sunlight, a good exposure is between 100 kilolux seconds and 1000 kilolux seconds, and the effective ISO is around 0.0001. 
(The original method has an ISO of around 0.000005)

It doesn't get as dark as the [classic formula](/projects/take_a_photo/#ironcyanotype), maxing out at the dark blue as shown in the image.
This can actually an advantage for photography because it keeps the contrast manageable:
The original formula tends to have very dark shadows, bright highlights and little in the way of midtones. 

## Design notes:

The standard iron-ferricyanide/cyanotype formula has a number of problems:

1. The reaction is self limiting.

Because the pigment is formed during the exposure, it blocks light and slows down the reaction.
The result is that it needs an exposure that's much longer then it needs to be.

2. Pigment washout.

A lot of pigment gets lost during washing.
Even though they are insoluble, small particles can get suspended in water and carried away ---
resulting in missing highlights at best and the entire image disapearing at worst.

3. Limited paper compatibility.

Alkaline buffered paper just doesn't work.
The base effect the photochemistry itself, leading to a blotchy appearance and also bleaches the pigment over time. 

4. Poor QE.

The final problem is that citrate really isn't a good electron donor for photo-reduction. 
Of all the carboxillic acids, iron (III) oxalate is best at responding to light.
The reaction is also pH sensitive, and works bestin an acidic environment, something that isn't present in the classic formula.

[1] can be fixed by using a two step process, where the iron (III) salt is applied to paper, exposed and only then treated with ferricyanide.
For [4], ferric ammonium oxalate is available, but it's easier to just add oxalic acid to ferric ammonium citrate.
The excess acid also takes care of the pH issue.

As a bonus, the oxalic acid also takes care of [2] because it results in larger pigment crystals and [3] because it neutralizes any buffers that may be present.

Iron (III) oxalate based formulas tend to leave a yellow stain composed of Iron (II) oxalate on the paper, which can be dissolved in citric acid.
Doing this during development also allows the otherwise trapped iron to contribute to image formation.
