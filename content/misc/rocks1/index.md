I recently went on a rock collecting trip, but apart from the usual --- quartz, K feldspar crystals, garnet, etc --- I found some slightly radioactive rocks:

<center style="color: gray">~5 CPS above background on contact with the RC-102.</center>
<br>

<center style="color: gray">~13 CPS above background on contact with the RC-102.</center>
<br>

<center style="color: gray">~20 CPS above background on contact with the RC-102.</center>
<br>

![](/misc/rocks1/rock4.jpg)
<center style="color: gray">~40 CPS above background on contact with the RC-102.</center>
<br>

All of these were found using my [prospecting scintillator](/projects/ludlum3/), but I took measurements with a Radiacode 102 --- a very common hobbyist detector --- so that other people can compare readings. 
Despite being small, it is still a gamma scintillator, so the count rates are much higher then any G-M tube. 

None of these are crazy hot, but they were all collected off the surface:
I didn't bring any good digging equipment on the trip.
(Really should have considering how my detector is able to pick up deeply buried specimens)

I feel like I've got to say this: <b>Being around rocks like this poses absolutely no hazard to your health.</b>
Yes, they are detectably radioactive, but so are bananas and that nice granite countertop in your kitchen. 
If you have any old and colorful ceramic items (cups, bowls, plates, tiles, etc), there's a good chance they <a href=https://www.orau.org/health-physics-museum/collection/consumer/ceramics/fiestaware.html>glazed with uranium</a>, making them very radioactive...
but still safe to eat out of.

The biggest hazard with my rocks is dropping them on your toes.
Even if you were to grind them up and inhale the dust, [the host rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis)
is much more of a danger then the radioactivity. 

I've personally been in multiple residential and office buildings that are more radioactive then my specimens because of the stone that was used to construct them. 

Also, if you have any "Anti-Radiation" or "Bio Energy" or "Quantum Energy" *wellness* products:
[they are quite the opposite. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7TwBUxxIC0) (and many are [spicier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BA5bw1EV5I) then my rocks.)

... or how about some [nice decorative glass](https://bcv.glass/collections/uranium-tableware)? [It glows](https://www.orau.org/health-physics-museum/collection/consumer/glass/vaseline-uranium-glass.html)
