# My corner of the internet:

Mostly electronics and software, but occasional chemistry and photography.
Feel free to check out [my photos of space](/tags/astro/), [random programs](/tags/software/), [weird electronics projects](/tags/electronics/), and [atom arranging](/tags/chemistry/).

I have my very own (copyright respecting) [nonsense generator](/babble/entry-point) -- guaranteed to be cheaper then any LLM --
and utility URLs for checking your <a href="/whoami">IP address</a> <a href="http://v4.maurycyz.com/whoami">(v4)</a> <a href="http://v6.maurycyz.com/whoami">(v6)</a> and <a href="/whatami">User-Agent</a> string. 

Because search engines are increasingly terrible, here's a [list of blogs](/real_pages/) I have found useful or interesting, and can verify are not LLM generated.
