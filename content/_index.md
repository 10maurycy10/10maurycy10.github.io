Hello stranger, this is a site where I post random stuff I do.

Feel free to check out the navbar on the side of this text. (on the top if you have a narrow screen)

If for some reason you want updates when I post, use the [RSS feed](https://10maurycy10.github.io/index.xml) ([Why RSS](about/whyrss))

The site itself is built from Markdown useing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and works without javascript or cookies.
