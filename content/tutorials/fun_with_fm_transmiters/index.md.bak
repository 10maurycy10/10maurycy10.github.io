It is surprizingly easy to make a working fm transmiter with just one transistor and a handfull of passive compontents.

![Schmatic diagram of a simple FM transmiter](base.png)

This circut runs from a single 9 volt batter for around 100 hours.
The coil is 6 turns of solid core hook up wire wraped arround a 3mm form, and the anntenna is 30-90cm of wire.
With a audio siganal from a headphone output is connected between ground and the 100nF capacitor, the audio can be head on a nearby FM radio.
Another 100nF capacitor can be connected accross the power suppy/battery to improve performace.

The frequency should be adjusted to an empty channel by spreading out/compressing the coil.

# Simplest bug

![Schematic diagram of transmiter with microphone](bug.png)

The additon of an electret microphone and use of a 9v battery for power turns allows this transmiter to transmit your voice, or any other converstaions in a room.
(Note that useing such a device to listen in on people without there concent in illegal in all of the US)

This wont pick up quite noises in the room, for that, an audio amplifyer stage is required:

Both of these cirutes can be built small enough to fit neatly on top of the battery.

# Fox hunting beeper

This is a two (three with the second RF stage describe later) transistor device, that transmits a beeping sound, functioning as a beacon.

This is not very practical as an item tracker due to the high power consomption, and low battery life.

# Improving freqency stability

These circutes work but the frequency chages a lot from something as small as moving your hand next to the antenna, and sometimes the occilation breaks down entirely.
The solution is antother RF stage (this has the added benifit of reducing radated harmonics):

Keep everything outside of the green box the same as whatever circut you want to modify.

# Antenna

Idealy the antenna would be two identical wires, one one the output, and one on the circuts ground (0v line). 
In practice, it still performs well when one side is much sorter than the other. (even just the size of the circut itself)
If the circut is mounted in a metal box, take advantage of it by connecting it to the negative side of the battery.

# Legality

This section only applies to the US.
From my understanding of part 15 of the FCC rules, low power transmiters are allowed in the FM broadcast band (and quite a few other places) from 88 to 108 MHz.
As long as you dont go outside of that range (you can check with an occiloscope or FM radio), or transimit with higher power than these circuts with the recomented antenna, you are not breaking the law.


The actual limit for signals with less than 200khz bandwith on the FM band is 250 ÂµV/m @ 3 m
