A Crystal radio is a great project, with just a coil of wire, a diode, and a variable capacitor you can build a working AM radio. 
Unfortunately, getting any kind of sensitivity and volume with a Crystal set requires lots of effort and fine tuning, and even then the sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired.

A simple form of amplified receiver, the regenerative set, requires only a single amplifying element.
Lots of vacuum tube based designs exist, but tubes are hard to buy and very power hungry.

# Part list

- 200 pF varable capacitor. (Get one with a shaft and maching knob if you can)
- 30 pF varable capacitor. (Get one with a shaft and maching knob if you can)
- 15 pF fixed capacitor
- 100 pF fixed capacitor
- 1 uF fixed capacitor
- 10 uF fixed capacitor
- Coil, details on winding it follow
- 2.5 uH choke, hand wound or factory made
- 2.7 KOhm resistor
- 1 MOhm resistor
- High impedence speaker (800 Ohm to 2000 Ohm)
- N type JFET transistor. (such as the J310)
- Source of 16 to 20 volt power (two 9volt batterys work well)

(Exact values are not critical, but a large devation will require fine tunning.)

# Schematic

[GSchem schematic files](regen.sch)

In most varable capacitors, the shaft is connected to one of the termainals, ensure that this is the terminal connected to ground.

Failing to do this will leed to massive hand-capacitance issues.

# The coil

The coil should be wound on a form of arround 2in/4.3cm such as a toilet paper roll or PVC pipe.

For the nicest and most compact results, it should be wound with magenet wire, but any fine insulated wire will work.

The tank coil should have arround 60-80 turns, and the ticker should have around 10.

# Antenna

The circut must be grounded, outlet ground works fine.

As an antenna, a length of wire (2-4 m seems to work best) suspended in the air works great. (A finger also works, but this causes hand capacitance problems)

# Fine Tuning

The first thing to adjust is the regeneration: depending on the position of the regeneration control (30 pF capacitor), the radio should ether make a loud squeel or buzzing noise, or be quite. This should happen at all positions of the tunning capacitor (200 pF)

If it allways makes noise:

- Try reducing the supply voltage (dont go below 16 V)
- Remove some turns of the regeneration coil

If it is always silent:

- Increse supply voltage (You shouldt have to go higher than 20 V)
- Add fixed capacitor in paralel with regen contol
- Add more turns to regen coil

# Operation

The regen contol (30 pF) should be adjusted to be right on the edge of squeeling. At this point static should be audable in the speaker.

Now *slowly* sweep through the range of the tunning capacitor (200 pF), while continuing to readjust the regen controll. Once you get close to a signal you will hear a single pure tone, continue adjusting the tuning cap so that the frequeqncy of the tone goes down and eventuly disapperes, being replaced with the transmission.

# Issues with this circut

- It is not very loud, even when the regen is set high enough that the audio is distorted, the volume is rather quiet.
- Due to the lack of isolation between the tank circut and the antenna, this radio does radiate a bit.
