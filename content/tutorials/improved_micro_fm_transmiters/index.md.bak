Here are the full schematics for a (slightly improved) FM bug and beacon with a class-C output stage described in the [last post](fun_with_fm_transmiters).

Bug:

Beacon:

The improvements consist of 2 modified resistor values, the emitter resistor on the occilator stage (Not much power is neaded for the output stage), and the bias resistor for the amplifier.

Together these changes allow the device to run 1.5x as long with almost no effect on output power.

# Construction advice

The most important thing is to pack components closly together. 
Perfboards/Matrixboards are a good way to create a compact and resiliant layout.

The coils are 6 turns of insulated wire arround a 3mm diameter form, and should be adjustable if a trimmer cap is not used. (able to be compressed/streched out to change freqency).
If a non adjustable coil is used, or more acurate tuning is desired (to hit an empty channel in an area with lots of stations), a varable/trimmer capacitor cab replace the fixed capaciter paralel to the coils.

The antenna should be 30 cm of insulated wire. (longer wires may violate the power limit in the US, check local laws)

# Adjustment

First tune a FM radio to an empty channel (failing that, the one with the weekest signal), then adjust the coil (or the capacitor) in the midle of the schematic to set the freqency.
Once it is set right you should hear loud feedback (with the bugs) or a tone in the radio.
The other coil should now be adjusted to get maximum output.

# Further modifications

Keep in mind that these could put the device over the legal lmit for FM trasmitions without a licence in most locations.
A calibrated feild strenght meter is recomeneded to ensure comliance with local laws.

## Impedence matching

The imedence of the output stage is a few kohms, but the antenna is from ~75 to 50 ohms.
A transformer coupoling the final RF stage to the antenna could increase range substantialy.

## class-E output

Using a class A amp feading a MOSFET trasnstor feading a tuned circut, a class-E (switching) amplifyer can be constructed.
These can acheve efficences of up to 80%

## More voltage

Supplying more volatage to the class-C or class-E output stage will increase output power, but also lossess. Make sure to use power transistors with a heatsink
