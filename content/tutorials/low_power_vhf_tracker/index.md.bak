Expanding on the [foxhunt FM transmiter design](../fun_with_fm_transmiters#fox-hunting-beeper), using a pulse generator circut stolen from [Talking electronics](https://talkingelectronics.com/).
Instead of a contiunusly running transmiter and audio occilator modulated with a flashing led, this circut cuts only sends breef pulses to the audio and rf occilator, resulting in a dramatic battery life improvemtn. (1000 hours is possible)

This circut can also be expanded with a class-C second stage, giving good range or allowing a shorter antenna.
