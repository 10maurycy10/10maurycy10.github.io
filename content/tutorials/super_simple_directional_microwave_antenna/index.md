Variations of the "Cantenna" project have been floating around on the internet for a long time (mostly intended for 2.4 GHz WiFi).
However, despite the abundance of calculator tools, there is a lot of conflicting information and very little in the way of explanations.
I will try to explain how they work, the math for designing one, and provide measurements for 2.4 GHz WiFi 5 GHz WiFi, and a correct calculator tool.

A "Cantenna" is a type of Waveguide antenna, a Waveguide is basically a metal tube that functions sort of like an RF hose.
Similar to how sound will travel down a tube, radio waves will travel down a metal tube.
However, Waveguide = RF hose is a bit of an oversimplification, as there a several ways RF can travel down a waveguide, known as modes.
Each mode has its own cutoff frequency's, the maximum and minimum frequency that radiowave have to have to be able to propagate using it.

There a lot of modes but the one that we want for a directional antenna is TE1,1, however we *don't* want the TM0,1 mode to work to ensure all the energy is transferred as TE1,1.

**You don't have to understand all this math, I will provide calculation results for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi**

For TE1,1 in a circular waveguide, the frequency must be at a minimum \\( \frac{1.841 c} { \pi d \sqrt{k} } \\), where \\(d\\) is the diameter, \\(c\\) is the speed of light (300 MHz m) and k is the dialectic constant of the material inside the waveguide (for air, this is 1).
For TM0,1, the minimum frequency \\( \frac{2.403 c} { \pi d \sqrt{k} } \\).

We can use this to compute a diameter range for the antenna for any frequency: \\( \frac{1.841  c}{\pi f} < d < \frac{2.403  c}{\pi f} \\).

The lower limit is hard, it will not work *at all* with a smaller diameter, the upper limit is less important, the antenna will simply lose some efficiency.

Here is a table of wavelengths and ideal diameters for an antenna for WiFi and a few satellite downlinks (these make great DIY feedhorns for dish antennas).
For wide bands like 5 GHz WiFi, I have used the lower frequency, as these antennas are more effected by being to small than too big
|Use|Frequency|Wavelength (Î»)|Min Diameter|Max Diameter|
|--|--|--|-|-|
|**2.4 GHz WiFi**|2412 MHz|120 mm|73 mm|95 mm|
|**5 GHz WiFi**|5150 MHz|58 mm|34 mm|44 mm|
|GOES 16 downlink|1686.6 MHz|177 mm|104 mm|136 mm|
|C Band downlink (lower)|3700 MHz|81 mm|47 mm|62 mm|
|C Band downlink (upper)|4000 MHz|75 mm|43 mm|57 mm|
|Ku Band|12000 MHz|25 mm|14 mm|19 mm|

To efficiently create a wave in the TE1,1 mode, you need monopole antenna that is a quarter of a wavelength long, and spaced a quarter of a wavelength from the closed end of the can.
The reason for this is that the wave, as it travels towards the closed end, is phase shifted (delayed) by 90 deg (1/4 of a cycle), then the reflection is phase shifted by 180 deg, and finally by another 90 deg during the return trip.
Once the reflected wave reaches the monopole, it is been shifted 360 deg and syncs up with the radiated signal, creating a stronger signal.

The length of the antenna is not critical, but a longer antenna will have better directivity, I recommended at least 3/4 wavelength.

# Construction

Most designs on the internet call for a RF connector and some coax, but If you have a WiFi dongle (this might also work with an SDR) lying around, you can cut off it's internal antenna and solder on the monopole to the output of the dongle.
The ground of the dongle should be connected to the waveguide.
Nearly all dongles use an meandering inverted F antenna, where one side is connected to ground, in the middle there is the RF feed point, and on the other side of the feedpoint is a meandering wire to nowhere.
To connect these to the antenna, cut off the antenna, connect the monopole to the feed point, and the waveguide to the ground connection.
If you get lucky, (The Netgear A6000 has this) the antenna will be a metal strip soldered to the board, but with smaller dongles it is common for the antenna to be a printed circuit board trace, which makes removing the antenna (you only really have to separate the feedpoint from the rest) and connecting it to the monopole will be annoying.

If you use a dongle, it will be annoying to plug it, but this can be fixed by adding a USB cable.
Simply cut one end off, strip off the outer sheath and any foil shielding on the cable, and solder it to the USB contact pads. (In a dongle, the PCB is a part of the USB connector).
The typical right ordering (I would recommended testing with a multimeter, some cables are weird) is, with the pads facing you, from left to right: Black, Green, White, Red.

The antenna can be constructed out of any metal tube (this will be the waveguide) with a closed end, like a opened can (metal lined is ok) at least 1/2 wavelength in length and within the diameter range.
If you can't find a conductive tube, you can wrap a plastic tube in aluminum foil, making sure that the foil is flat to the surface and making a good connection all around, as well as covering the back.
I recommend wrapping more than one turn of foil, and tapeing the turns together, making sure to have foil-foil contact.
Drill a hole 1/4 of a wavelength from the back of the tube, to connect an monopole antenna inside of the waveguide.
To make the actual monopole, cut stiff wire to 1/4 of a wavelength.

Solder the wire to the pin of the connector or the RF output of the dongle, and place it trough the hole, making sure the wire is perpendicular to the waveguide's surface, and *not touching the waveguide* (a bit of heat shrink tubing helps here).
Connect the shield of the RF connector or the ground of the dongle to the waveguide.

# Applications

The antenna is linearly polarized, in the same direction as the monopole is, so try rotating it to improve signal strength, and directional, so it has to be pointed at the other station's antenna to work well.

The antenna can be used as is, as a high gain antenna for wireless networking, Bluetooth (same band as 2.4 GHz WiFi), providing a good 12-14 dB of gain over the stock antenna (25 times more signal!)
With 2 antenna's, facing each other, you can get as good as 28 dB gain (500 times as much signal).

A short one (3/4 wavelength total length) makes a good DIY feedhorn for a a dish antenna, allowing satellite downlinks or insane wireless network range, with just a few milliwatts.

You can also turn one into a horn antenna, by adding a metal horn onto the end of the waveguide.

# Calculator

This is a tool for quickly calculating the dimensions of the antenna:

<script>

function update() {
    var round = Math.round;

    var c = 300 * 1000; // Speed of light, in mm MHz
    var pi = 3.14
    var freq = +document.getElementById("freq").value;
    var wavelength = c/freq;
    document.getElementById("wavelength").innerText = round(wavelength) + "mm";
    document.getElementById("monopole").innerText = round(wavelength/4) + "mm";
    document.getElementById("minlength").innerText = round(wavelength*3/4) + "mm";

    var lower_limit = 1.841*c/(pi*freq);
    var upper_limit = 2.403*c/(pi*freq);
    document.getElementById("mind").innerText = round(lower_limit) + "mm";
    document.getElementById("maxd").innerText = round(upper_limit) + "mm";
}
